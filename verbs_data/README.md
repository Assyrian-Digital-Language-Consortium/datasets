# Verbs lexical data fro nena_corpus
* data.json was given to me by Mathew Nazari.
* It has verbs lexical data such as root, pattern, tense, definition, etc. I beileve from 
Cambridge Semitics Lab.
* It's in simplified IPA.
* It has 1300 entries. 
* I believe we may have more as Arabic, as I have seen somewhere, has ~ 8000 verbs.
* Maybe useful to convert using Sargis' tools to Assyrian script.

## TODO: Expanding the list
* I have additional list, in csv format, from Daniel Shammon's book: ܓܪܡܛܝܩܛ ܕܠܫܢܐ ܐܬܘܪܝܐ ܕܪܝܐ that I need clean up and will upload soon.
